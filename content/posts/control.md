Control is an amazing game with an amazing atmosphere. While a little short I think it suits it well, and after playing it about 2 weeks ago as of writing this… I think it’s become one of my favorite games I’ve played so far!

You play as Jesse Faden, in search of her brother who was taken away by the FBC (Federal Bureau of Control)… which is basically the SCP foundation. 

The gameplay in control is something akin to a metroidvania, just more linear than a game you’d traditionally call a metroidvania. The game while mostly story focused has someo side content, especially with the two DLCs—that being said it’s still quite short. I’ve heard of people finishing the game in like 9 hours. I got the [plat](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZqxTEynWDY) in about 19. Finished both the DLCs in 21 I think.

One of my favorite things about the game is actually a specific area—one you visit a couple times throughout the game: **The Ocean View Motel and Casino.**

It’s a liminal space. In the plot it is used as a sort of security measure by the Bureau. It is just so *vibey* I absolutely love it. You don’t spend a lot of time in the area throughout the game—obviously since it is a liminal space. But every time I got to go there I would get so excited lol.
