So recently I’ve been playing Elden Ring, and it is incredibly awesome! As of the time of writing this I have clocked in around 32 hours in the game have beaten quite a few bosses.

## Delayed Attacks
Having played two (technically 3 but Sekiro doesn’t count) other FromSoft games: Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, I was super surprised by the amount of delayed attacks in the game… basically all of the bosses have some delay to most if not all of their attacks, along with one or two attacks that are INCREDIBLY delayed. It really caught me off guard and I still am not used to it, as in the games I’ve played this was a very rare occurrence—in DS3 I can only think of one boss with delayed attacks and that’s The Nameless King. 

Thought all that isn’t to say I dislike the delayed attacks, I think they promote more skill expression as you can’t just roll spam to dodge them, you actually have to learn the timings and positioning in order to successfully dodge them which I think is very rewarding. In DS3 you can get away with roll spamming on most bosses but Elden Ring will heavily punish you for it, panic dodging means getting hit for most of your health or even just straight up dying. I do enjoy it.

## Summons
I think summons make the game too easy. I’ve only used them fully on Radahn as I thought, might as well since you’re literally meant to, it’s canon :D.

And I tried using a summon on Margit when I first started playing, however it trivialized the fight so much that I decided right at the end to just jump off the map and kill him without summons—and also decided I wouldn’t use summons for the rest of the game.
