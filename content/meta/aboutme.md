Contrary to the title of the webpage, my name is infact not Ran—Ran is just a nickname essentially. My name is actually *Rei* (Yes I know very different from Ra) and I like video games.

I started playing video games when I was about 6 or 7 years old, and the first game I think I ever played was GTA:SA... yeah at 7 years old. I still have not finished that game to this day but the nostalgia factor means it holds a special place in my heart. I actually still watch YouTube content for the game, mainly from Joshimuz a great YouTuber/Streamer and GTA:SA speedrunner.

Other than GTA, I did play a few games growing up. The usuals, Roblox, Minecraft (lots of PvP on cracked servers lol), and a few unusual ones that have stuck with me to this day: The Binding of Isaac,Brawlhalla, Don't Starve. They were my first introduction to indie games basically.

Some of my favorite games are: Persona 5 The Royal—this one is special to me because I played it during a very hard time in my life and it kept me going basically. Absolutely love this game. Another one is Bloodborne, my first souls game, I never got to play the DLC but, I love the game. Other souls I've played as of the time of writing this (2025-03-17) are Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, both of which I love to death as well.

One more game that I truly consider a masterpiece is, The Witcher 3. The amount of love put into that game is insane and I absolutely loved every moment of playing it.

In the same vein, Hollow Knight is a masterpiece as well. And I can't wait to play Silksong when it releases in 2046!!!

Big fan of the Yakuza Series as well.

While I do prefer single-player games, I do like me a good multiplayer game as well. The two that come to mind when I think of multiplayer games I've played are of course the two I've also played the most, probably out of any game so...

- Apex Legends

At almost 3000 hours of playtime now (Yes 3000), I can't really say I don't enjoy the game lol. It's been with me since I was quite young obviously and it has changed a lot in the time I've been playing it (Basically almost since release.)

- Brawlhalla

I don't have much to say about it other than... I first played it when it was in alpha and have kept playing it, I think I have around 800-1000 hours in the game but I still suck at it so I don't really play it very much anymore.
