      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a list of games that I&amp;rsquo;ve played. Some of them I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet played to the end. It&amp;rsquo;s in no particular order, I might order it alphabetically at one point but I am too lazy to do that right now (Even though it would take 2 seconds with chatgpt) It&amp;rsquo;s also not exhauative because I probably can&amp;rsquo;t remember some of them. I&amp;rsquo;m also not counting games that I&amp;rsquo;ve only played for a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the title of the webpage, my name is infact not Ranâ€”Ran is just a nickname essentially. My name is actually &lt;em&gt;Rei&lt;/em&gt; (Yes I know very different from Ra) and I like video games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started playing video games when I was about 6 or 7 years old, and the first game I think I ever played was GTA:SA&amp;hellip; yeah at 7 years old. I still have not finished that game to this day but the nostalgia factor means it holds a special place in my heart. I actually still watch YouTube content for the game, mainly from Joshimuz a great YouTuber/Streamer and GTA:SA speedrunner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
